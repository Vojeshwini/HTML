                            Coorg or Kodagu is the smallest district of Karnataka. It lies halfway between Mysore and the coastal town of Mangalore. It is a beautiful land situated amongst wavy hills. It is inhabited by a proud race of martial men, beautiful women and wild creatures. Its thirty per cent area is covered by evergreen forests and it is famous for its coffee and spices. Monsoon brings a lot of rain here. The best time to visit Coorg is between September and March as the weather is perfect with an amazing smell of coffee. Many coffee estates and colonial bungalows are scattered around the prime areas.
